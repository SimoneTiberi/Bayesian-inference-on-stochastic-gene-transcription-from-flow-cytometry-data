# Bayesian  inference on stochastic  gene transcription from flow cytometry data
The page containts the R code and the exprimental data used for the analyses presented in the paper: "Bayesian  inference on stochastic  gene transcription from flow cytometry data".

The material is organized in three folders:

-"Background data" contains the raw background data and R code used to obtain a prior for the measurement error;

-"Experimental data" has the experimental data for both conditions and the measurement error prior;

-"R code" reports the R code used for the main analysis and to reproduce plots and figures.
